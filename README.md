# Dyslexia-Friendly Validation Report Generator

This tool creates enhanced Dyslexia-Friendly Validation Reports from chapter-level readability data. Reports are formatted as multi-page PDFs including:

- Title page with average readability score
- Z-score heatmap of key features by chapter
- Paginated Outlier Tables with styled formatting
- Chapter-specific narrative insights
- Full Feature Explanation Appendix

## üîß How It Works

This module assumes you have a `.csv` file exported from the Dyslexia Readability Analyzer containing chapter-level metrics.

### üìâ Limitations & Intended Use

> **Disclaimer:** This tool uses a lightweight, simplified implementation of sentence and word counting to support rapid and scalable analysis. While effective for relative comparisons and visualizations, it is **not intended to match the precision** of more mature tools like **Microsoft Word's Readability Checker** or professional linguistic platforms.

> As a result, all output values ‚Äî including **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level** and **Dyslexia-Friendly Score** ‚Äî should be treated as **approximate**. These values are not suitable for publication-quality analysis and should **not be used for clinical or educational diagnosis** without further validation.

> The core utility of this tool lies in **highlighting trends**, **detecting outliers**, and **supporting exploratory research** on narrative-level readability in long-form fiction.
